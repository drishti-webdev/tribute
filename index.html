    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>
        Indira Gandhi was the first and only female Prime Minister of India.
        She was known for her strong leadership, determination, and courage.
        She served as Prime Minister from 1966 to 1977 and again from 1980
        until her assassination in 1984.
    </p>

    <p>
        What I admire most about Indira Gandhi is her fearless personality and
        her dedication to serving the nation. She made bold decisions and stood
        strong during difficult times, showing great leadership and confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
        She inspired millions of women across the world by proving that women
        can lead nations with strength, intelligence, and determination.
        Her legacy continues to inspire future generations.
